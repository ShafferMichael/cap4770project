# CAP770: Final Project

## Overview

This project conducts a comprehensive analysis to explore the correlation between changes in ocean temperature and the annual fluctuations in Scottish salmon catches over the period from 1955 to 2022. By utilizing historical climate and fisheries data, we aim to understand how marine environmental changes have impacted salmon populations and fishing yields, providing insights that could inform future fisheries management and conservation efforts.

## Additional Notes

- It's good practice to update the `requirements.txt` file whenever you add or remove dependencies from your project:

    ```bash
    pip freeze > requirements.txt
    ```

- Always activate the virtual environment before working on the project to ensure correct dependencies are used.
